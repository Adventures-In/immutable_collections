# Immutable Collections

A package for experimenting with immutable collections.  

The first goal is an immutable list that plays nicely with freezed.

## Usage

Currently there is only an immutable list:

```dart
import 'package:immutable_collections/immutable_collections.dart';

main() {
  var immutableList = new ImmutableList<CustomType>();
}
```
