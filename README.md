# Immutable Collections

A package for experimenting with immutable collections.  

[Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwHADP5_LLNfL6-h51zqqcY480H6yPmknsPju4bOD1g/edit?usp=sharing)

The first goal is an immutable list that plays nicely with freezed. Then a basic map that also works with freezed.

## Usage

Currently there is only an immutable list:

```dart
import 'package:immutable_collections/immutable_collections.dart';

main() {
  var immutableList = new ImmutableList<CustomType>();
}
```
